Fibration building blocks of a information flow network represent the sets of nodes that are symmetric with respect to the processing of information, that is, the sets of nodes that process equivalent information. Here, we have reproduced important results concerning the identification and classification of the fibration building blocks of directed networks, constructed from real network data. More specifically, using the transcriptional regulatory network data of the \textit{Escherichia Coli} bacteria, we quantify the clusters of nodes that synchronously process equivalent information and then we classify these clusters, called network fibers, based on its specific topological features. This way, in order to consistently present the obtained results, in this report we first give a brief description of the theory concerning the graph fibration morphism and its main definitions related to information flow symmetries. Next, we detail the methods adopted to correctly identify and classify the network fibers. More specifically, to establish an optimal framework, I show the implementation details of the Minimal Balanced Coloring algorithm used to find the corresponding fibers in the network, presenting a slightly improvement for the algorithm complexity and its implementation. At last, showing the proper methods for data preparation, I describe the results obtained concerning the fiber statistics for the specific case of the \textit{Escherichia Coli} regulatory network, to properly compare with the recent results presented at \textit{Morone et. al.} (2019).
