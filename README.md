# fibration building blocks algorithms

Based on the work from the @makselab, The codes here are written in both `C` and `python` and are intend to be used
for the identification of minimal fibration building blocks of directed networks. Also, we identify the types of fiber
blocks in a given network according to the `fiber numbers` `< n,l|`.

We apply these algorithms on the `E. Coli` transcription factor gene regulatory network in order to reproduce the results
of the recent work published by the @makselab.
